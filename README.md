# How To Help With Climate Mirror
This guide is designed to give you ways to contribute to Climate Mirror, regardless of your skill level.


## Mirroring Data
### Hosting or attending a DataRefuge Event
The best way you can help with mirroring data is to work with our partners at [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge)
by attending or hosting a Data Rescue event. These events involve gathering many volunteers into a space for a day or weekend
in order to collectively copy data. DataRefuge provides a toolkit of information, including the roles each person plays in
archiving data. These events are excellent ways to participate because you get the advice of expert archivists and the quality
of obtained data is high due to the procedures and toolkit they provide. 

 * If you would like to *organize/host* an event, you can [find out more information here](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarescue).
