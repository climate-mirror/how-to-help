# How To Help With Climate Mirror
This guide is designed to give you ways to contribute to Climate Mirror, regardless of your skill level.

## Mirroring Data
### Hosting or attending a DataRefuge Event
The best way you can help with mirroring data is to work with our partners at [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge)
by attending or hosting a Data Rescue event. These events involve gathering many volunteers into a space for a day or weekend
in order to collectively copy data. DataRefuge provides a toolkit of information, including the roles each person plays in
archiving data. These events are excellent ways to participate because you get the advice of expert archivists and the quality
of obtained data is high due to the procedures and toolkit they provide. 

 * If you would like to *organize/host* an event, you can [find out more information here](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarescue). 
 You do not need to be a data expert to host an event, but it's a good idea to try partnering with a library. If you're interested
 but have questions, it's worth contacting DataRefuge at the link above.
 * If you are interested in attending an event, you can [see a listing of upcoming events here](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge)
 
### Mirroring Data from Home
If you can't make it to a DataRefuge event and don't want to organize one on your own, getting involved with ClimateMirror
at home is a great way to contribute. To do this, you should
1. Have some sort of large storage available (ideally publicly accessible)
2. Have a decent working knowledge of using the Internet, including accessing FTP servers.

#### Join us on Slack
Before you mirror data, you should sign up to [join our Slack team](https://climatemirrorslackinvite.herokuapp.com/)
so that you can chat with other members of Climate Mirror about approaches and get help for any issues you're having.

#### Getting started
The URLs that need mirroring are listed in our [datasets repository](https://github.com/climate-mirror/datasets/issues).
For those not familiar with using GitHub, each item there is an "issue" - a task that can be tracked. If you click to open each
one, it will have additional details, and a comment thread to help you coordinate with anyone else working to mirror that
dataset.
